# Food-Classification

### Abstract
The purpose of this project is to take different images of food items and attempt to classify them
into categories. There are 50 different types of food used, with 1,000 of images per type, resulting
in 50,000 images to sort through. I used the Convolutional Neural Network model to break a part
the images and learn them piece by piece. During the preprocessing stage, each image needed to
be resized and scaled. The labels for each image needed to be reformatted to create one hot
representation. After experimenting with the layers, nodes, and attributes, the model was found to
have a max approximate 25% accuracy reading for the images used.
